# idle-game
Level-based Tower/wall defense 
- Different kinds of enemies come walking down your kingdom wall 
- Your wall HP is based on the HP of your total characters 
  - You can only have up to 5 characters on your wall for defense 
- Every level has a wave of monsters, and at the end, you fight a stronger opponent 
  - Every 5 or 10 levels, you fight a boss 
- Enemies get stronger, and different enemies start showing up the farther you proceed 
- Every character has a basic attack and 2 ults that cost mana 
  - One ult is more for attacking, and the other is for support 
- The idle part of the game is that your characters fight monsters and collect rewards 
  - The reward amount is based on your level
  - You can get coins, weapons, and armor
  - You can only collect idle rewards for up to 48hrs
- Use coins to upgrade strength, HP, and mana regen, upgrade weapons, and new characters 
- Character stat increase is based on the character, but every level gives the same amount of increase 
  - Every time you level up your HP, you get X amount of HP, but that X amount changes based on each character 
- The character level is the average of hp, strength, and mana stats → all decimal rounds down 
  - Strength level 5, hp level 7, mana level 2 → character level 4
- Characters gacha and starting character 
  - You start with the basic character, Roland, with basic stats 
  - There are many characters you can earn through the gacha system
    - You can only use the gacha once a day → still deciding if I should do this
    - Each character you can get can have 3 different rarities that increase the stats on that character 
    - Each character has unique stats that can be upgraded
    - Each character has their basic weapon (sword, bow, staff, gun) and starts with no armor (chest, pants, boots, gloves, helm, ring)
      - You can collect weapons and armor by clearing levels and by the idle system
